## text-sed (wip) üìöüî•üí≠

Implementation of Strudel et al.'s ["Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion for Text Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04236) in PyTorch and some other goodies üç≠.

## Install üíª

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev, train]"
```

## Experimental Samples 

Non-cherry picked samples from various experiments to track progress with the eventual goal of reproducing the results from the paper using large scale pre-training. 

* __Unconditionallly__ generated samples obtained from training text-sed on the simple [E2E](https://huggingface.co/datasets/e2e_nlg) dataset for 17k steps with the config [here](configs/e2e.yaml).

## TODOs

* [ ] Add span masking and cfg for conditional generation.
* [ ] Add EMA warmup.
* [ ] Add Karras samplers.
* [ ] Add conditional generation examples/samples.
